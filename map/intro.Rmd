<p style="font-size: 20px; "color: red;"> A youth initiative for the City of Chicago launched in May 2020 to connect young people, ranging from the ages 0-24, with out-of-school programs with the <strong>aim</strong> of creating a city-wide network for youth to easily discover and cultivate their passions and talents, as well as strengthen and center their identity and voice. </p>

### Our Goal

We hope to visualize the equity of opportunity for the City of Chicago's youth to have access to and participate in local out-of-school programs across the city's diverse neighborhoods and communities. 

We would like to understand how accessible are <strong>different categories</strong> of programs for <strong>different ages</strong> of youth? Do youth in <strong>different communities/regions</strong> of Chicago have the same access to similar types of programs? 

Since online technically serve all geographic regions of Chicago, we will separately analyze online programs and compare the results with those from in-person programs. However, we do acknowledge that the engagement and experiences vary between the different program types.
