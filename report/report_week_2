Progress:
* Downloaded and reviewed data
* Picked weekly meeting time and met once
* Thought of a general plan of where we want to take this project
    * Create a shiny app of map plots with density of programs for each region
    * Make options for different age groups and categories
* Started a simple EDA
* Data cleaning
    * Dropped 167 observations because they didn't have region, lon/lat, nor address data

Plan:
* Shruti:
    * Geo_join, push data that's been spatially joined, send word cloud script
* Rhona:
    * Write EDA Rmd file, few visualizations
* Emma:
    * Create visualizations for EDA, cleaning data (take out unnecessary vars,
      deal with duplicate data points, deal with missing data etc.)
